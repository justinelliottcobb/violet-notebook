# Violet Notebook

- A wee wiki-style notebook in [Remix](https://remix.run/)

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Build for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Run in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
